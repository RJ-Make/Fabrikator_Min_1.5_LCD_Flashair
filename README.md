# Fabrikator_Min_1.5_LCD_Flashair
Files needed to add an LCD display and Toshiba Flashair WiFi SD Card support to the Fabrikator Mini 1.5 3D Printer. 

Special thanks to Chuck Hellebuyck (@ChuckHellebuyck) for the LCD version of the Marlin firmware and to Mr.RC-Cam of the RC-CAM forum for the work around.
